  # Create customer reviews table

  1. New Tables
    - `reviews`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `reviewer_name` (text) - customer display name
      - `rating` (integer, 1-5) - star rating
      - `title` (text) - review headline
      - `body` (text) - review content
      - `verified` (boolean) - whether purchase is verified
      - `product_name` (text, nullable) - which product was reviewed
      - `created_at` (timestamptz) - when review was posted
  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `reviews` table
    - Add read-only policy for anonymous users (reviews are public content)
    - Only authenticated service role can insert/update/delete
  3. Seed Data
    - Insert initial customer reviews
